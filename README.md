# FastICA

Implementation of FastICA algorithm on two voices to separate them



## Code

This project contains:

	1- Python (.py) files to implement the FastICA (independent component analysis) algorithm
	2- voices (.wav) files for algorithm application.


## Files

* Python files:
    * main.py: _main script to load data, run FastICA algorithm, generate plots, and play audio._
    * ICA.py: _contains functions to implement FastICA algorithm._
    * plotting_functions.py: _contains functions to visualize data._

* Audio files:
    * Two voices for a male and female
